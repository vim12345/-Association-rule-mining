# -Association-rule-mining

# Description:
Association Rule Mining is used to uncover interesting relationships between variables in large datasets. Itâ€™s commonly applied in market basket analysis to find product combinations that frequently co-occur. In this project, weâ€™ll use the Apriori algorithm to extract frequent itemsets and generate association rules using the mlxtend library.

# ðŸ›’ What This Project Demonstrates:
* Applies the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets

* Generates association rules with support, confidence, and lift

* Uses a transactional-style dataset and one-hot encoding
